# Getting Started

1. `1.Building_Your_First_Campaign.ipynb`  - Guides you through building your first campaign and recommendation algorithm. 
2. `2.View_Campaign_And_Interactions.ipynb` - Showcase how to generate a recommendation and how to modify it with real time intent. 
4. `Cleanup.ipynb` - Deletes anything that was created so you are not charged for additional resources.

You can download the Jupyter notebooks from the `/notebooks` folder or deploy the following Cloud Formation template which clones this repo.
