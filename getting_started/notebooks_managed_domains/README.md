# Getting Started

This tutorial outlines the process of building your own recommendation model using use-case optimized recommenders, testing them  and then cleaning up all of your resources to prevent any unwanted charges. To get started executing these, follow the steps in the next section.

1. `01_Building_Your_First_Recommender_Media_and_Entertainment.ipynb`  - Guides you through building your first media and entertainment recommender and getting your first recommendations.
1. `02_Building_Your_First_Recommender_Retail.ipynb`  - Guides you through building your first retail recommender and getting your first recommendations.
2. `Cleanup.ipynb` - Deletes anything that was created in the previous notebook so you are not charged for additional resources. Note: make sure you run this notebook after each of the notebooks above, as it will only delete the latest resources.

You can download the Jupyter notebooks from the `/notebooks_managed_domains` folder or deploy the Cloud Formation template which clones this repository.
